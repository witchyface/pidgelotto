Overview:

Cmdibuzz is a Minecraft Fabric mod (1.20.1) designed to enhance server administration and gameplay by adding some elements of randomisation to command execution. With Cmdibuzz, server administrators can define pools of commands which can then be executed in a random fashion for a player. A use case example for this would be if an administrator wanted to award a player a random Nature Mint.
