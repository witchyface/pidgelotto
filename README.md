# Pidgelotto  

## Overview  

Pidgelotto is a Fabric mod for Minecraft (1.21.1) that adds a fully customizable lottery system to your server. With it, admins can set up automated lotteries that run while the server is online, giving players a chance to buy tickets and win prizes when the draw happens.  

The name "Pidgelotto" is a mashup of "Lotto" and the Pokémon "Pidgey"—or even its evolution, Pidgeotto! It’s a nod to my love for Pokémon and my experience managing a Cobblemon server.  

## Features  

- **Automated Lotteries:** Set up a lottery that runs on a timer, allowing players to participate without admin intervention.  
- **Grace Period:** Configure a pre-lottery waiting time to give players a chance to buy tickets before the draw begins.  
- **Fully Customizable:** Adjust nearly every aspect of the lottery, including:  
  - Ticket price  
  - Maximum number of tickets available  
  - Ticket purchase limits per player  
  - Lotto duration  
  - Cooldown between lotteries  
  - Fallback prize in case no winner is drawn  
- **Live Config Reloading:** Apply config changes on the fly without restarting the server.  
- **Time Command:** Players can check how many seconds are left in the Grace Period, the Lotto, or the Cooldown.  

With Pidgelotto, you can bring an engaging, automated lottery experience to your server while keeping full control over its mechanics.
